# PatchesModel

A population model based on "Samuel Perini, Marina Rafajlović, Anja M. Westram, Kerstin Johannesson, Roger K. Butlin, Assortative mating, sexual selection, and their consequences for gene flow in Littorina, Evolution, Volume 74, Issue 7, 1 July 2020, Pages 1482–1497, https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.14027". 

This is a work in progress. The model is currently more or less finished, but with significant performance issues.
